        <h1>Zachary Lutes, Software Engineering Student</h1>
        <p>My name is Zachary Lutes. I am 29, and spent the last three years in prison. For nearly two years of that I was in Clallam Bay Corrections Center, in a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2013/convicts-coders-prison-system-experiments-computer-science-training-program/">computer science</a> program that gave me a laptop and a prison cell. I threw myself into it. I didn't have the benefit of the internet, but the infrastructure of the program included terabytes of books and whitepapers, articles and miscellania. Hundreds of books on every programming language from COBAL to Lua. I only knew python, but would read these books and try and perform the excercises in python instead. Weeks after I enrolled, COVID-19 hit and the world shut down. Life for a prisoner in a remote setting like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clallam_Bay,_Washington">Clallam Bay</a>, life continued as though nothing had changed. Nobody fell ill, masks were forgotten until an administrator was in the vicinity. Inmates and staff alike laughed about the COVID hoax, but I was nestled in my room, coding. I read, and read. I spent hours, days on the python interpreter. I had already been a linux user, so the command line was an old friend. The classroom of this penitentiary computer science program was well stocked with computers and data, but the more vibrant presence was the cadre of inmates for whom this program had been a way of life for years preceding my arrival. Most of these guys were not getting out. One was in the final stages of recieving clemency, release after a sentence of Life Without Opportunity for Parole. There was another individual who I immediately hit it off with, who had been in prison since he was 14 (he was 40), when he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Middle_School_shooting">shot up his middle school</a>. He is an incredible coder now, and was integral in the creation of what was quite possibly the most innovative and productive prison education project in the United States. Weeks turned to months, and I completed hundreds of hours of coding excersises. I prepared for release, and was dead set on maintaining my sort of monastic coding routine once I was released. After all, I'd have the internet, which meant a capacity for expansion of knowledge many orders of magnitude above what I made do with inside. So, then, I was released, re-united with friends and family, and picked flat-iron academy to help me establish an identity as a working developer.</p>
